<blockquote>
  <p>A <strong>Manifold</strong> is an n-Dimensional Topological Space that is locally Euclidean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Lie group is a topological group that is also a smooth manifold. Each of them is associated with a Lie algebra which is a vector space. Transformations are required to be <strong>composed, inverted, differentiated and interpolated</strong>. Lie groups and their associated machinery address all these operations in a pricipled way.</p>
