  <p>Graph matching has wide application in computer vision community, e.g. image matching, mesh matching. It embeds the topology structure into matching process, which is helpful to improve accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="preliminaries--definitions">Preliminaries &amp; Definitions</h2>

<h3 id="planar-graph">Planar Graph</h3>
<p>In graph theory, a planar graph is a graph that can be drawn in such a way that no edges cross each other.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-graph">Semantic graph</h3>
<p>A semantic graph is a graph-structured data representation in which vertices represent concepts (e.g., movie, actor) and edges represent relationships between concepts (e.g. appeared-in). Both vertices and edges in a semantic graph are typed and attributed.</p>

<h3 id="graph-isomorphism-同构">Graph isomorphism (同构)</h3>
<p>A isomorphism of graphs <script type="math/tex">G</script> and <script type="math/tex">H</script> is a structure-preserving bijection between the vertex sets of <script type="math/tex">G</script> and <script type="math/tex">H</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f: V(G) \rightarrow V(H)</script>

<p>such that any two vertices <script type="math/tex">u</script> and <script type="math/tex">v</script> of <script type="math/tex">G</script> are adjacent in <script type="math/tex">G</script> if and only if <script type="math/tex">f(u)</script> and <script type="math/tex">f(v)</script> are adjacent in <script type="math/tex">H</script>.</p>

<h3 id="labeled-graph">Labeled graph</h3>
<p>A labeled graph is represented as a tuple <script type="math/tex">G=(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E}, \mu, \nu)</script>, where</p>

<ul>
  <li><script type="math/tex">\mathcal{V}</script> is the set of vertices,</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V}</script> is the set of edges,</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">\mu : \mathcal{V} \rightarrow \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{V}}</script> is the vertex labeling function with <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{V}}</script> the vertex-label set (e.g. the descriptors of feature nodes), and</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">\nu : \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{E}}</script> is the edge labeling function with <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{E}}</script> the edge-label set (e.g. the angles between edges and feature orientations).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="formulation">Formulation</h2>
<p>The goal of graph-based pairwise image matching is to establish correspondences between two sets of visual features.</p>
